The programs for the paper were written in C language. These files were complied successfully under a Mac OS with the use of GSL library. All relevant subroutines are in one file (data_ana.c).  It requires an external minimizer/maximizer subroutine. The mybfgs.c contains the conjugate gradient algorithm.  In addition, the main function needs the random variable generator subroutines  from the open source GSL library. The C codes can be easily translated into R.
